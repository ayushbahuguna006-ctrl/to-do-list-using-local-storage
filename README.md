📝 To-Do List App (Local Storage)

A simple and responsive To-Do List web application built using React that allows users to add, delete, and manage tasks.
All tasks are stored in the browser using Local Storage, so your data persists even after refreshing the page.

🚀 Features

➕ Add new tasks

❌ Delete tasks

💾 Persistent data using Local Storage

⚡ Fast and lightweight

🎨 Clean and simple UI

📱 Responsive design

🛠️ Technologies Used

React.js

JavaScript (ES6+)

HTML5

CSS / Tailwind CSS (if used)

Local Storage API

⚙️ How It Works

Tasks are stored as an array in localStorage

On app load, tasks are fetched from localStorage

Any change (add/delete) updates localStorage instantly

This ensures tasks remain saved even after page reloads
